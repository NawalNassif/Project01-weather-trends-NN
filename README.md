# Project01-weather-trends-NN
Exploring similarities and differences of weather trends between Beirut and other cities.

In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data 
and compare temperature trends in my area to global temperature trends. 
First, I use a SQL query to extract the raw data from the database 
and save it as a CSV file. 
I analyze data in Excel and create appropriate visualizations 
to show similarities and differences between my city, Beirut, 
and other cities around the world. 
This was my first project as part of my data analyst nanodegree education.
